        <h1>How does this connect to Computer Science?</h1>
         <p>
             Programming langauge is the foundation of computerscience.
             Without the langauge, there is nothing that computers can runon, or anyother piece of technology.
             We use code in driving, reading your screens, and doing basically anything you can imagine that involves technology.
             Alice, Scratch, and HTML are all based on different programming langauges.
             Some are a drag and drop style while others are a text based program.
             Each has it's benefits and drag backs such as text and be more advanced but harder and more complex to use.
             Drag and drop is easy to but can't go as indepth.
         </p>
         <h1>How does this connect to Computer Science</h1>
         <p>
             Robotics uses a wide variety of programming langauges.
             Robot C is based on basic C but with certain functions added to enhance the experience and control the robot.
             Python is another option along with Meshkit which are all viable option to for VEX IQ, the entry level robotics but aren't enough for the advanced VEX EDR.
             Robot C++ is based of C++ which is an advanced version of C with many added features.
             This code allows for the most advanced code, such as built in PID, acceleration,
             and many other advanced features.
             Programming langauges are an essential part of the modern world.
             Nearly everyone has a smartphone, which needs software to run apps such as Instagram and Google Chrome.
             Without code, the technology can't understand what the user wants and is trying to-do.
             Code is also a very fun to play around with since you can make games, apps, websites,
             and program other things to complete tasks like voice recognition, facial recognition, or just basic commands that helps you do stuff.

         </p>
         <h1>Summary</h1>
         <p>
             Programming langauges are used in everything.
             Phones, computers, even your cars are run off programming languages.
             Without this essential langauge, nothing would be able to run, everything would become chaotic,
             the world could never run.
